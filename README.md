## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is a company that wants to a build a system to help learning drivers practice for their official tests by doing on the road training as well as online practice exams and classes.

## What did you do particularly well?

I felt I did really well on outlining the functional and nonfunctional requirements for the system. I believe my past experience as well as my understanding of what DriverPass wanted helped me througly lay out all of the requirements needed for a successful product.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would probably revise the class diagram to include methods which were not required for the submission but would greatly help in understanding what each object's function was. The objects felt more like pojo's (a Java thing) rather than a functional part of the system.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I put a special priority on user's needs when designing the software for the client. I knew that the user would need to be able to use the system without performance issues even on small screens such as a phone. In the end, the user makes the product successful. Even if it solves a problem in the real world, if the user feels impeded by poor performance then they will not use the program. With that in mind I wrote the requirements with the objective of designing a system that would work for all customers and require little maintenance after deployment.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approached it with a performance first perspective. I want the systems I design to work well under large traffic and also be easy to update when necessary. I prefer a platform independent approach to design as much as possible which means using languages or frameworks that have multiple platforms in mind for coding. An approach where my designs are performant, user viewpoint inspired, and platform agnostic is what I will attempt to use for similar software applications in the future where possible.
